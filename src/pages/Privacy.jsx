            store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you're using. When

            When you create a Kaggle account, submit competition entries or otherwise use the Services, you provide us with
            personal information that includes your name and a password. You may also provide your mailing address and
            home/mobile phone number, or other personal information.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-base mb-4">
            Your provision of this personal data is required for you to enter into the <a href="#" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Terms of Use</a>, a contract with us, as well as for
            you to enter competitions hosted on the Services. These entries are also a contract between you and the competition
            host, and we need your personal information to host the Services offered under that contract (see the <a href="#" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Terms of Use</a> for
            additional information). If you do not provide the minimum amount of personal data required to register an account,
            including your name and email address, you cannot use the Services, as this information is necessary for contractual
            reasons. Certain parts of the Services also require you to provide a mobile phone number, which is needed to protect
            against fraud and abuse. Please see "European Requirements" below for further information on the bases for our
            processing your personal information.

          <p className="text-base mb-4">
            When you use the Services, we send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric
            characters – to your computer. For example, we use cookies to ensure proper navigation between pages on the
            Services. Kaggle may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close
            your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on
            subsequent visits to the Services.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-base mb-4">
            Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser's "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify
            your cookie settings. If you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Services, you may not be able to utilize
            the features of the Services to their fullest potential.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-base mb-4">
            We may also implement on the Services third party content, such as advertising or analytic services, that uses "clear
            gifs," "web beacons," or other similar techniques, which allow the third party content provider to read and write cookies
            to your browser or implement similar tracking mechanisms. This information is collected directly by the third party, and
            Kaggle does not participate in that data transmission. Information collected by third parties in this manner is subject to
            that third party's own data collection, use, and disclosure policies. We currently implement services provided by Google
            Analytics and Facebook.

          <h4 className="text-lg font-bold mb-3">Linked accounts</h4>
          
          <p className="text-base mb-8">
            When you link an account you may have on a third party service (such as a third party social networking site or email
            provider) to your Kaggle account, Kaggle collects certain information stored in connection with that account that you
            have configured that service to make available, including your email address, provider ID, first and last name, and
            profile picture. By linking your accounts in this manner, you authorize Kaggle to access and use your account on the
            third party service in connection with your use of the Services.

            We use your information to deliver our Services, like administering competitions you enter or hosting datasets you
            upload or access. For example, we use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested,
            such as loading a dataset. Another example is that we use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us
            authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Kaggle account.
